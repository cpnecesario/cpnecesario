- 👋 Hi, I’m Tatene!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool projects.
- 📫 Reach me through cpnecesario@up.edu.ph

P.S. I have a cat who likes to sleep on top of my keyboard so if somehow my codes won't work, never ever blame my cat.
